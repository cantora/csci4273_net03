example usage: 
host1> make test_arch ARG="per-protocol echo 48484 56789 elra-04.cs.colorado.edu"

host2> make test_arch ARG="per-protocol active 56789 48484 98.245.122.67 "

creates the main test program and runs the per-protocol architecture.
the 'active' flag causes the test program to connect to another instance
of the test program on host 98.245.122.67 which is running under 'echo'
mode (as opposed to 'active' mode). the active program sends 100 messages from
each protocol and records the time it takes for the echo instance to echo each
message back to the active test program.
